As of now I don't have a method for sumbiting bots, but I will try to flesh out the testing method plan here.
Soooo, there is the classic elimination bracket, but I think, depending on how many submissions we get and to
make the rolling submission work pretty smoothly I will be pitting each bot against every other bot, the one with the
best record wins. (yes this does mean there can be ties, deal with it. (dealing with it also includes suggesting fixes (oooh parathases within parathases with more parathases to point it out)))
